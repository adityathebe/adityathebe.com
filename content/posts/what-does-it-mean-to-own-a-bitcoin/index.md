The notion of owning a bitcoin can be difficult to grasp to anyone who has dealt with cash all their life.

When Bob says he has $5 we can understand that he either has a $5 bill or \$5 in his bank account.

But what does it mean when Alice says she owns 5 BTC ? Does it mean that there are 5 actual real physical coins that are named to Alice ?

Most of the things that I've written in this blog post, I've learned it from the book **"Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopolous**. It's [open sourced](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) !! I am writing this blog post to put down in words the things that I've learned from the book and in hopes to help at least a single bitcoin enthusiast.

> Disclaimer: This post only deals with the techinal aspects of owning a bitcoin; not political, not economical, not legal or any other \*-cal imaginable but just the technical aspects.
