## AI Related Posts

Set an `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment before running `gatsby build` or `gatsby develop` to let the build pipeline generate AI-powered related posts. Embeddings are cached in `data/related-posts-cache.json` (override with `RELATED_POST_CACHE_PATH`); remove that file or run `gatsby clean` to force regeneration. Tune strictness with `RELATED_POST_MIN_SCORE` (defaults to `0.35`) or switch models via `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`.
