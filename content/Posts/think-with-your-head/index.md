description: Don't think with your fingers
---

I have been writing blogs on this website for almost about 10 years now and honestly every time I have sat down to write a blog it would take me hours And I would never complete the blog post in one sitting. I would put in a draft and keep coming back to it for several days before finally publishing it. 
Because it was just too difficult or unnatural to write a blog post. The words just didn't come to me naturally. And I think that's because I used to think with my fingers. You know, when you think of words, when you think of what to write, while your hands are on a keyboard, there's just some disconnect. You know, the words just don't come naturally to you. 

Whenever I first thought of writing a blog, I would just have a draft in my head on what to write and it would sound really good. But then when I sat down and actually started to write, I would go blank. And the chain of thought just gets broken constantly because you're typing at the same time you're thinking.

Now that's going to change because a few days ago I discovered this application called [superwhisperer](https://superwhisper.com/). I came across it from a video by [Andrei Karpthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw) where he shows how he uses LLMs and apparently the way he interacts with LLMs or even his computer is this, like half the time is through dictation. So I installed this application and I've been using it for a few days, like not even, not more than three days. And honestly, it's, it's highly, highly, highly underrated. I cannot, I cannot praise it enough.

So the first thing that came to my mind when I installed this application was that I could write my prompts to LLMs easily, but then it hit me that I could use this tool to write all my blog posts. And in fact, all of the writings I've done so far in this blog, I did that through that app. So I really spoke into a mic and then I've converted that to text.

And let me tell you the difference is, what's the word for, what's the word that I'm looking for? It is, the difference is just, I don't know, let me Google that. Claude just told me "night and day". So yes, the difference is night and day.

I think even you can tell that this blog post feels much more natural. It feels like someone speaking to you because in a sense that's exactly it. I'm really speaking out these words.
My eyes are closed and the words are just flowing out like a river.

> I've also always tried avoiding using LLMs for my blog post because I didn't really wanna fill my blog with words that didn't come from me, but from an AI model. The nice thing about using superwhisper is that while you're still using AI, you're not using it to generate thoughts, but just to transcribe your own thoughts.

To top it off, the tool is completely* free. I mean it has premium offerings that will let you use a much more powerful models. But I've been using the basic, like literally the most basic model it offers in a free tier. And it's so, so good.
It also runs locally so I don't need to be connected to the internet and my laptop is powerful enough that it's just instant.

The first time you install the software it gives you 15 minutes of credit to use the top speech to text models.
I used the 3GB Ultra model that still works locally but you can also choose to use a cloud model so you don't have to download the model locally. 
It was quite good but the free model that I'm currently using is honestly good enough that I don't ~want~ need to get the premium version.
So I'm just gonna stick to it for now & see how it works out.
And if I feel like it's inadequate I will be more than happy to get a subscription.

I think that's it for this post. I honestly cannot believe that the amount of time this tool is going to save me and also the improvement in the quality of my writing in this blog. This blog took me just 5 minutes to "write" and then 10 more minutes to edit and finalize it.
