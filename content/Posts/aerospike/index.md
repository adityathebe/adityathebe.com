This is an extremely basic introduction to Aerospike. It's basically a compilation of resources to help you quickly get started.

## SQL Analogy

I think the best way to start learning Aerospike is to establish an analogy with SQL databases.

![Conceptual components of Aerospike Data model](./conceptual-components-of-aerospike-data-model.png)_Conceptual components of Aerospike Data model_

<div id="post-table">

| Aerospike     | SQL         |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| NameSpace     | TableSpace  |
| Set           | Table       |
| Record/Object | Row         |
| Bin           | Column      |
| Key           | Primary Key |

</div>

Knowing this much will be sufficient to get us started.

## Install Aerospike

I'd recommend installing Aerospike with Docker just because it's simple that way. For this article, I'm using version `5.5.0.2`.

```bash
# Download aerospike docker image
docker image pull aerospike:5.5.0.2

# Start docker
docker container run -p 3000:3000 --rm aerospike:5.5.0.2
```

Aerospike server, by default, runs on port 3000. The `-p` flag tells Docker to map the container's port `3000` to our system's port `3000`. The flag `--rm` will automatically delete the docker container after we stop the aerospike server.

You also need to download the Aerospike Go package which is officially available at `github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go`

```
go get github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go
```

With both of these installed, let's get started.

## 1. Connect to Aerospike from GO

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	as "github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go"
)

func main() {
	client, err := as.NewClient("localhost", 3000)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	client.Close()
}

```

These few lines of code will connect to Aerospike and then close immediately.

## 2. Create a Set

Naturally, the next move you'd think would be to create a **Set** as we do in relational databases. However, that's not required in Aerospike because our table (Set) does not have a fixed schema.

> The data model is determined through your use of the system. For example, if you wanted to add a new data type to a record, you would write that data type into the record without having to first update any schema

## 3. Inserting data

Although we didn't need to explicitly create a Set, we do however require one. Let's call our Set `"Person"`.

And also a namespace is mandatory. Let's name it `"Avengers"` for lack of a better word right now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The namespace cannot be created from a client but needs to be configured in the server itself. By default, a namespace called _"test"_ is created automatically. Let's create our namespace by modifying the docker command. We can pass in a `NAMESPACE` environment variable to the docker container and it'll create the namespace for us.

```
docker container run -e 'NAMESPACE=Avengers' --name 'Aero' -p 3000:3000 --rm aerospike:5.5.0.2
```

I've assigned a name to the docker container so that's it'll be easier to reference it later.

Close the previous container and run the above command to restart the Aerospike server.

### 3.1 Storing Records

For every record that we want to store, we need a key to identify that record; just like a primary key in RDBMS. Let's use the person's name as the key üôÉ.

Then we need to create the record itself. Just so we have a reference, let's try to insert the person's age and the name.

```
# Reference SQL table
+-----+----------+
| age | name     |
+-----+----------+
| 25  | "Aditya" |
+-----+----------+
```

"age" and "name" are columns (bin). We can create them like this

```
binAge := as.NewBin("age", 25)
binName := as.NewBin("name", "Aditya")
```

Finally, to piece everything together here's the code to store the record.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	as "github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go"
)

const Namespace = "Avengers"
const Set = "Person"

func main() {
	client, err := as.NewClient("localhost", 3000)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Create key for a record
	key, err := as.NewKey(Namespace, Set, "aditya")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	binAge := as.NewBin("age", 25)
	binName := as.NewBin("name", "Aditya")

	client.PutBins(nil, key, binAge, binName)
}
```

_Notice that I never explicitly create the Set "Person". It is created automatically on-demand_.

The `PutBins()` method can take in any number of bins. If you supply two bins with the same name, then the latter will take precedence.

### 3.2 Different way to create and store bins

Instead of creating each bin one by one, we can instead create a BinMap.

```go
binMap := as.BinMap{
  "age":  25,
  "name": "Aditya",
}

client.Put(nil, key, binMap)
```

To me, this looks neater and I think is more readable. Then we can use the `.Put()` method to store the bins.

### 3.3 PutBins() vs Put()

So we have two methods to insert bins. Which one should you prefer? Well internally, `Put()` uses `PutBins()` and the [Official Best Practices](https://docs.aerospike.com/docs/client/go/usage/best_practices.html) recommends using PutBins over Put to avoid allocation for binmaps.

## 4. Reading records

We can read the records from Aerospike using the **Key**.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	as "github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go"
)

const Namespace = "Avengers"
const Set = "Person"

func main() {
	client, err := as.NewClient("localhost", 3000)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Create key for a record
	key, err := as.NewKey(Namespace, Set, "aditya")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	binMap := as.BinMap{
		"age":  25,
		"name": "Aditya",
	}

	client.Put(nil, key, binMap)

	// Read a record
	record, err := client.Get(nil, key)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(record.Bins)
}

// OUTPUT
//s map[age:25 name:Aditya]
```

In addition to reading records with the key, Aerospike also offers a basic query language. It's similar to SQL but nowhere near as powerful. Here's an example query

```sql
SELECT * FROM Avengers.Person WHERE age BETWEEN 15 AND 30
```

_I won't be discussing Aerospike Query language (AQL) in this article._

## 5. Deleting records

We can delete specific records by the key or drop the entire records in the Set.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	as "github.com/aerospike/aerospike-client-go"
)

const Namespace = "Avengers"
const Set = "Person"

func main() {
	client, err := as.NewClient("localhost", 3000)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Create key for a record
	key, err := as.NewKey(Namespace, Set, "aditya")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	binMap := as.BinMap{
		"age":  25,
		"name": "Aditya",
	}

	client.Put(nil, key, binMap)

	// Read a record
	record, err := client.Get(nil, key)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(record.Bins)

	// Delete Record
	existed, err := client.Delete(nil, key)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	if existed {
		fmt.Println("Record deleted")
	}
}
```

Droping the entire records in the set

```
client.Truncate(nil, Namespace, Set, nil)
```

## 6. Policy

Did you notice that the first argument when inserting and reading records was set to `nil`? That parameter is the policy. A Policy helps us define the behavior of read and write operation and much more. For example: what happens when we insert a record with a key that already exists? We can define a policy to overwrite the previous data or ignore the one being inserted.

Let's create a write policy that'll tell Aerospike server to replace old records if new ones arrive

```
policy := as.NewWritePolicy(0, 0)
policy.RecordExistsAction = as.REPLACE

```

## 7. AQL

Aerospike offers a command-line utility - AQL. It comes preinstalled in the docker image we downloaded. Let's get an interactive shell on the container

```bash
docker container exec -it Aero aql
```

Try out these few queries

```
SHOW NAMESPACES;

SELECT * FROM Avengers.Person;

TRUNCATE Avengers.Person;

SHOW BINS;
```
