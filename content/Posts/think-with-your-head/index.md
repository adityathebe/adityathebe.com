description: Using SuperWhisper to write better blog posts
---

I have been writing blogs on this website for about 10 years now, and honestly, every time I've sat down to write a blog post, it has taken me hours. And I would never complete the blog post in one sitting. I would put in a draft and keep coming back to it for several days before finally publishing it.

That's because it was just too difficult or unnatural to write a blog post. The words just didn't come to me naturally. And I think that's because I used to think with my fingers. You know how when you think of words while your hands are on a keyboard, there's a disconnect? The words just don't come naturally to you - or maybe it's just me. 

Whenever I first thought of writing a blog, I would have a draft in my head of what to write, and it would sound really good. But then when I sat down and actually started to write, I would go blank. And the chain of thought just gets broken constantly because you're typing at the same time you're thinking.

Now that's going to change because a few days ago I discovered an application called [SuperWhisper](https://superwhisper.com/). I came across it from a video by [Andrei Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWvNQjAaOHw) where he shows how he uses LLMs and apparently the way he interacts with LLMs or even his computer is through dictation about half the time. So I installed this application and I've been using it for a few days. And honestly, it's a game changer. I cannot praise it enough.

So the first thing that came to my mind when I installed this application was that I could write my prompts to LLMs easily, but then it hit me that I could use this tool to write all my blog posts. And in fact, all of the writings I've done so far in this blog, I did that through this app.

And let me tell you the difference is, _what's the word I'm looking for? The difference is... let me think... Claude just told me "night and day"._ So yes, the difference is **night and day**.

I think you can tell that this blog post feels much more natural than my other blog posts. I assume it feels like someone speaking to you because in a sense that's exactly it. I'm really speaking out these words.
My eyes are closed and the words are just flowing out like a river.

> I've also always avoided using LLMs for my blog posts because I didn't want to fill my blog with words that came from an AI model rather than from me. The nice thing about using SuperWhisper is that while you're still using AI, you're not using it to generate thoughts, but just to transcribe your own thoughts.

To top it off, the tool is completely* free. I mean it has premium offerings that will let you use much more powerful models. But I've been using the most basic model offered in the free tier. And it's so, so good.
It also runs locally, so I don't need to be connected to the internet and my laptop is powerful enough that it's just instant.

The first time you install the software it gives you 15 minutes of credit to use the top speech to text models.
I used the 3GB Ultra model that runs locally, but you can also choose a cloud model if you don't want to download anything to your device. 
It was quite good, but the free model I'm currently using is honestly good enough that I don't ~~want~~ need the premium version.
So I'm just gonna stick to it for now & see how it works out.
And if I feel like it's inadequate, I will be more than happy to get a subscription.

I think that's it for this post. I honestly cannot believe how much time this tool is going to save me, not to mention the improvement in the quality of my writing on this blog. This blog post took me just 5 minutes to "write" and then 20 more minutes to edit and finalize because I'm not articulate.
